          <p>
            I am Isaac Adjei. Most people know me as Zac. I am an Electronic Engineering and
            Computer Science student at Aston University, Birmingham, working towards a First Class
            BEng. My goal is to build at the intersection of intelligent software and efficient
            hardware, creating systems that solve real problems for real people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Ghana, attending Adisadel College in Cape Coast, a school guided by the
            motto &ldquo;Vel Primus, Vel Cum Primis&rdquo; (Either the first or with the first).
            It instilled in me resilience, discipline and a standard of excellence that still shape
            everything I do. I was an active member of the Robotics Club, Scripture Union, PENSA
            and the Debate Society. I lost sight in my right eye at age two due to retinoblastoma
            and have lived with monocular vision my entire life. Rather than limiting me, it
            sharpened my focus and shaped a deep commitment to accessible technology, building
            systems that genuinely serve all users.
          </p>
          <p>
            My late father was a mechanical and refrigeration engineer. During school vacations I
            accompanied him on site and watched engineering come to life in his hands. He always
            said: &ldquo;Always strive to make things better.&rdquo; Between 2019 and 2021 I
            worked as a Junior Apprentice HVAC Technician in Accra, servicing and installing over
            50 air conditioning units in the field. In 2022 I relocated to the UK and after two
            months on a business course at Stanmore College I knew engineering was where I belonged.
            I approached the college, sat the necessary entry exams and transferred onto the
            engineering programme, graduating with D*DD in the Pearson BTEC Level 3 National
            Extended Diploma in Engineering and being recognised as Best and Most Hardworking
            Student in my cohort.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Aston I serve as Student Representative at the Students&apos; Union and am a
            Student Member of the IET and a member of ESOC and the Aston African-Caribbean
            Society. In 2026 I was shortlisted as a Top 40 Finalist for the Black
            Heritage Undergraduate of the Year Award, run by TargetJobs and Sky to recognise
            high-achieving undergraduates across the UK. Beyond university I have gained experience
            in different sectors: internships at the Ghana High Commission London as a Consular
            Intern and an Admin and Estates Intern, virtual engineering programmes with British
            Airways and Yunex Traffic and between 2022 and 2025, while studying full-time, working
            as a Waiter and Food Runner at Casa do Frango Piccadilly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technically I work across the full stack: bare-metal C and C++ on microcontrollers, PCB
            design in KiCad and Proteus, full-stack web with Next.js and TypeScript, and
            Python-based machine learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch. I am also expanding into
            Java, cloud computing, cyber security and game development. My projects include a
            two-stage audio amplifier PCB built from scratch, a 4x4x4 NeoPixel LED Cube with four
            animation modes, Phaemos (a predictive maintenance platform with a FastAPI backend and
            Isolation Forest anomaly detection), an open-source Git course with over 200 structured
            topic files and Zaccess, an accessibility tool that converts lecture slides and textbook
            pages into high-contrast readable notes using OCR and text-to-speech.
