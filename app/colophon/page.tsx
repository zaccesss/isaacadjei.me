Spotify retired its audio-features and audio-analysis APIs in November 2024, so the visualiser no longer tries to react to the sound - instead it extracts the dominant colours from the album art and renders a sine wave above a bouncy equaliser, both tinted from the cover, on a device-pixel-ratio canvas animated on delta-time and tuned for light and dark mode.

Genre tags come from <A href="https://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm</A> (Spotify retired artist genres in 2025). The progress bar ticks every second client-side. The widgets poll two small edge-cached endpoints - a fast Spotify one (refreshed every few seconds, so song changes appear in near-realtime) and a combined snapshot for the devices, GitHub and Discord - and pause while the browser tab is hidden, so many open tabs share one cached response instead of each holding a connection open.
