              Every teacher who saw something in me and took the time to nurture it, from primary
              school through to university. The ones who challenged me, pushed back when I needed
              it and believed I could go further than I thought. Good teachers change the
              trajectory of a life and I have been fortunate to have had a few of them.

              something I do not take lightly.
