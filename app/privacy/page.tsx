            address is retained. This data is used only to understand which posts are read in full

            The public stats pages include a map of where my job search has reached. Loading it
            fetches map styles, tiles and satellite imagery from OpenFreeMap and Esri, so those
            providers receive your IP address and browser details in the normal way any request to
            them does. The map only ever shows the number of opportunities per city and nothing
            about individual applications. Some pages also embed Spotify and YouTube players, which
            contact those services when they load and may set their own cookies under their own
            policies.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            To protect forms and public endpoints from abuse I rate limit requests by IP address.
            The address is used only as a short-lived counter key and is not kept as a record of
            who visited.
