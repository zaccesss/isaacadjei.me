              I am Zac, an Electronic Engineering and Computer Science student at Aston University.
              I grew up in Ghana, relocated to the UK in 2022 and earned a triple Distinction in
              engineering, being recognised as Best and Most Hardworking Student at Stanmore College,
              before starting Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Aston. I work at the intersection of hardware and software,
              spanning embedded systems, machine learning and production web development.

              My late father was a mechanical engineer. His words, &ldquo;Always strive to make
              things better&rdquo;, still guide everything I build. I focus on accessible technology
              and systems that serve real users, the kind of engineering that matters beyond the
              screen.
