For favour that I did not earn and for doors that opened when they logically should not have. To my late father, whose hands built things and whose words, \"Always strive to make things better\", still run underneath everything I do. I hope you are proud, Dad. To my mum, who has carried this family with more strength than I can fully articulate, who has never stopped believing in us even when believing cost her something. And to my siblings: every good thing I build is built with you in mind. This one is for all of you.",

I grew up in Ghana, lost the sight in my right eye at two years old after surgery for suspected retinoblastoma, missed the first years of school because of it, attended [Adisadel College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adisadel_College) in Cape Coast where the motto is Vel Primus, Vel Cum Primis (either the first or with the first), lost my father in 2021, moved to the UK in April 2022 with no formal technical education behind me, enrolled at Stanmore College on a business course and switched to engineering two months in by sitting the entrance exams and catching up while working part-time.",

That sentence does not fully capture what it meant. git-unlocked is a complete open source Git curriculum: 217 files, every concept written and structured from scratch, MIT licensed. Publishing it formally on Zenodo with a DOI meant giving it a permanent academic record, an ORCID credit, a Google Scholar listing. That is my first peer-citable research output. I did not plan that. It grew from wanting to teach Git properly and then not stopping until the thing was complete.",

It is a predictive maintenance platform using IoT sensor data and machine learning and it is a real thing now, not a side project in the abstract. avr-zac is bare-metal C running on an ATmega644P: no HAL, no abstraction layer, just registers and timing and understanding exactly what the hardware is doing. The audio amplifier is a TL071 active filter and OPA551 unity-gain output buffer, designed, simulated, fabricated and tested by hand. I built a World Cup 2026 AI predictor. I have been doing competitive programming consistently for the first time since I started. I ran over 50 kilometres for [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org) during the 10 Days of 5K Challenge.",

Being in that room, surrounded by people who had built and contributed and been recognised for it, the fireside chat with this year's winner Valerie Fiamavle and last year's winner Nigel Danquah-Kuma, the conversations with Sky professionals across technology and product and media, all of it landed heavily. I wrote about the day properly in [the post before this one](/blog/sky-black-heritage-celebration-day). But the part I want to say here is this: I did not expect to get that invitation. And every time something like that happens, I come back to the same realisation.",

The Sky application asked about impact and character. git-unlocked exists because I wanted to teach something properly. Phaemos exists because I wanted to understand how production ML systems work. The amplifier exists because I wanted to know how hardware behaves at the signal level, not just in simulation. None of that was done for the application. The application just asked about who I already was.",

I think now it means something larger: that the posture of an engineer and really the posture of a person, should be one of active contribution. Not passive consumption. Not waiting for someone else to fix things. Building.",

Zaccess, the accessibility tool I built using OCR and text-to-speech to convert lecture slides into readable notes, did not start as a project with a vision statement. It started because I was struggling to read slides and decided to fix that.

The same passage, hands separate, slowing the tempo down until it is clean, then building it back up, is a discipline that has no equivalent in code. You cannot grep the problem. You cannot refactor the fingering into something more elegant. You sit with it until it works.",

The Aston work holding up. There is too much specificity in the provision for me to attribute it to effort alone. Effort was there. So was something else.",
