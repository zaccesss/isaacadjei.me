Looking back, it was mostly vibe-coded: I built it by piecing together things I had found online without deeply understanding what I was doing. It loaded fast, looked interesting and told you almost nothing about my actual work. No project pages. No blog. No way to see anything beyond a blinking cursor and a few hardcoded text responses.
