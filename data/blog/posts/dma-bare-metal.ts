        text: "Every time a microcontroller moves data using the CPU - reading bytes from a UART receive register, filling a display buffer, copying ADC samples into memory - the CPU is doing work that does not require the CPU. Each byte requires a load instruction, a store instruction and a loop iteration. At 1 MHz sample rates or when streaming data to a DAC, this becomes a significant fraction of available CPU time. Direct Memory Access (DMA) is the hardware mechanism that moves data between peripherals and memory without involving the CPU at all.",

        text: "A DMA controller is a dedicated hardware block that sits between the bus and main memory. It has its own internal registers: a source address, a destination address, a transfer count and a configuration register specifying the transfer size (byte, half-word or word), the direction (peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral or memory to memory) and whether addresses should auto-increment after each transfer. The CPU programs these registers then starts the transfer. The DMA controller takes over the bus, moves the data and fires an interrupt when it is done. The CPU is free to do other work throughout.",

        text: "The performance difference is substantial. Receiving 1024 bytes over SPI in software requires 1024 load-from-SPI-DR operations, 1024 store-to-buffer operations and 1024 loop iterations: roughly 3072 instructions. DMA moves the same 1024 bytes with the CPU executing essentially zero instructions for the transfer itself. On a system running at 72 MHz, this is the difference between occupying the CPU for 43 microseconds and releasing it entirely.",

        text: "Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a feature built into most modern microcontrollers that lets hardware peripherals transfer data directly to or from RAM without involving the CPU in each byte transfer. Think of it as a dedicated delivery driver for data: you tell it where to pick up (source address), where to drop off (destination address) and how many items to move (transfer count), then it does the work while the CPU handles something else entirely.",

These mappings are fixed in hardware and documented in the reference manual. Choosing the wrong channel for a peripheral simply does not work.",

This is the correct mode for continuous ADC sampling: configure DMA in circular mode pointing at a buffer, enable ADC continuous conversion and the DMA controller fills the buffer repeatedly. The CPU can process each completed half-buffer while the DMA fills the other half - a double-buffering pattern that is standard practice in audio and sensor data acquisition.",

        text: "On Cortex-M7 devices (STM32H7 and STM32F7 series) the CPU has data cache. DMA accesses main memory directly, bypassing the cache. If the CPU has cached a region of memory that DMA is writing to, the CPU reads stale data from cache rather than the fresh DMA-written values. The solution is to either place DMA buffers in non-cacheable memory regions (using the MPU or linker script DTCM allocation) or to explicitly invalidate the cache region before reading DMA-written data. Failing to handle this is one of the most common bugs when porting DMA code from Cortex-M4 to Cortex-M7 devices.",

        text: "Circular DMA with a single buffer creates a race: if the main loop processes bytes too slowly, the DMA controller will overwrite the start of the buffer before the main loop has finished reading it. The solution is double buffering with the half-transfer interrupt. Set up DMA in circular mode with a buffer twice the size you actually need. DMA fires two interrupts: half-transfer complete (HT) when it reaches the midpoint and transfer complete (TC) when it wraps around. While DMA is writing the second half, your ISR or main loop processes the first half. When DMA writes the first half again, you process the second half. The two halves never conflict.",
