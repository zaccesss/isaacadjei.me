It does not execute instructions. It does not have a CPU inside. It is something fundamentally different: a chip whose internal logic connections can be reconfigured by the user, effectively letting you build custom hardware circuits using software tools.",

There is no processor reading instructions. The computation is in the wiring itself.",

        text: "A modern FPGA contains three main types of resources. Logic elements (called LUTs - look-up tables - in most architectures) are small configurable truth tables that implement any boolean function of their inputs. Flip-flops store state. Block RAMs are fixed hard memories typically 18 Kbit or 36 Kbit in size, used for FIFOs, lookup tables and local storage. Higher-end FPGAs also contain DSP blocks (hardware multiplier-adder units), clock management tiles and, on devices like the [Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com) Zynq, hardened [ARM](https://developer.arm.com) processor cores alongside the programmable fabric.",

        text: "When you synthesise a VHDL or Verilog design, the synthesis tool maps your logic description onto these physical resources. A 4-input adder might consume four LUTs and five flip-flops. A 1024x8 dual-port RAM maps to a single Block RAM. The number and type of resources available determines what you can fit on a given FPGA. Understanding resource utilisation is as important for FPGA design as understanding memory layout is for embedded software.",

        text: "The hardest mental shift for a software engineer approaching FPGAs is that VHDL (and Verilog) describe hardware structure, not program execution. In software, you write a sequence of instructions that the processor executes one after another. In VHDL, you describe concurrent logic elements that all operate simultaneously every clock cycle. There is no notion of a function call that takes time to execute - combinational logic propagates instantaneously (subject to propagation delay) and registered logic updates on clock edges.",

In VHDL you describe: the sum output is the bitwise XOR of a and b with carry propagation from bit 0 to bit 3. The synthesis tool maps this to four LUTs with carry chain connections. The adder exists as permanent hardware. It is always computing a + b, every cycle, whether you read the result or not.",

In FPGA design, performance is constrained by the critical path: the longest combinational logic path between two registered stages. The maximum clock frequency is determined by how long signals take to propagate through this path. Adding pipeline registers between logic stages shortens each stage's critical path and allows a higher clock frequency at the cost of increased latency. This pipeline design pattern is fundamental to high-performance FPGA implementations.",
