When the ISR returns, execution resumes exactly where it left off. The CPU saves and restores the relevant registers automatically.

When an interrupt fires, the CPU looks up that table and jumps to the correct handler. On AVR devices, you define an ISR with the ISR() macro from avr-libc. On STM32 you use HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ() and write a handler with the exact name the linker expects.",

The choice depends on your system: if you care about response time more than absolute precision, the delay in the ISR is acceptable. If you are building a real-time controller, keep ISRs short.",

Subpriority only matters when two interrupts of the same preemption priority fire simultaneously - the one with lower subpriority number runs first. If you have a time-critical ISR (say, a UART byte receive) and a less critical one (say, a timer overcount), set the UART ISR to preemption priority 0 and the timer ISR to priority 3.

Most interrupt bugs are one of these three.",
