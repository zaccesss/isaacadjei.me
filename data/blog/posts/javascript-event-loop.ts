And yet web applications handle button clicks while fetching data, animate the UI while processing responses and run timers while doing everything else. The mechanism that makes this possible is the event loop. Most explanations reach for analogies - a restaurant, a to-do list, a queue at the post office. I want to explain what is actually happening in the runtime instead.",
