The solution was to cap brightness in software using the [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide) and never display full white on all LEDs simultaneously.

The result is a convincing upward flame despite the algorithm being under 30 lines of C++.",

The main lessons: use flux, keep your iron tip clean and solder each joint fully before moving to the next. Cold joints on LEDs in the middle of the chain are very difficult to diagnose because the entire section after the fault goes dark. Testing each layer with continuity checks before stacking them saved significant rework time.",

Disabling interrupts during LED updates was necessary for stable output.",
