The datasheet will either explicitly state 5V-tolerant on the relevant pins or list a maximum input voltage of VCC + 0.3V, which for a 3.3V device means 3.6V maximum. Exceeding this permanently damages the pin.",

This flag bit is set when there are unread data in the receive buffer and cleared when the receive buffer is empty. If the receiver is disabled, the receive buffer will be flushed and consequently the RXC0 bit will become zero. The RXC0 flag can be used to generate a receive complete interrupt (see description of the RXCIE0 bit).' That single sentence tells you: it is a status flag, not a control bit; it is read-only in that sense; it clears automatically when you read UDR0; and it connects to an interrupt enable bit elsewhere.",
