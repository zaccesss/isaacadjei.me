The result is eventual consistency with a lag of a few seconds, which is acceptable for presence data.",

The sensor node posts telemetry to the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) backend every 5 seconds; the Next.js dashboard could subscribe to an SSE stream from the backend rather than polling an API route every 5 seconds. The trade-off is that SSE requires a persistent server connection, which is straightforward on a dedicated server but requires additional routing on serverless infrastructure.",
