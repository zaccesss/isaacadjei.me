For a system that must respond to a button press within 10ms while simultaneously reading a sensor at 100Hz and transmitting over UART, the bare super-loop breaks down. This is the problem a real-time operating system (RTOS) solves.",

It does one thing: schedule tasks on a single processor in a way that gives each task predictable timing guarantees. That predictability is what real-time means in RTOS - not fast, but guaranteed to meet deadlines.",

Each task has a priority from 0 (lowest) to configMAX_PRIORITIES-1 (highest). The scheduler runs the highest-priority task that is ready to execute. If a higher-priority task becomes ready while a lower-priority task is running, the scheduler preempts the running task immediately and switches to the higher-priority one. This is preemptive multitasking.",

        text: "The context switch happens at a configurable tick rate, typically 1000 Hz (every 1ms). On each tick, the scheduler checks whether a higher-priority task has become ready and if so performs a context switch: saves the current task's register state and stack pointer, loads the next task's state and resumes execution. The context switch overhead on a Cortex-M4 is typically under 10 microseconds including all register saves.",

If the control loop runs late by even 20 microseconds, the motor current overshoots and can trigger an overcurrent fault or damage windings. In a bare super-loop, any task that takes longer than expected delays every subsequent task. An RTOS with a high-priority task for the control loop and a dedicated timer interrupt guarantees the loop runs on time regardless of what lower-priority tasks are doing.",

Industrial motor controllers and flight control systems are hard real-time. FreeRTOS is suitable for soft real-time and many hard real-time applications when correctly configured.",

Accessing a global variable from two tasks without synchronisation is a race condition: if the scheduler preempts a task mid-write, another task may read a partially written value. FreeRTOS provides queues for passing data between tasks safely. A queue is a fixed-size FIFO buffer. One task writes to it (xQueueSend) and another reads from it (xQueueReceive).

A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a binary semaphore with priority inheritance: if a high-priority task is waiting for a mutex held by a low-priority task, the low-priority task temporarily runs at the high-priority task's priority to release the mutex as quickly as possible. This prevents priority inversion, a scheduling hazard that famously caused the Mars Pathfinder rover to reset repeatedly until the issue was diagnosed in 1997.",

FreeRTOS provides a stack overflow hook (vApplicationStackOverflowHook) and a watermark measurement function (uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark) to detect and debug stack usage. A common practice is to set the stack size generously during development, measure the watermark and reduce it to the minimum safe value before release.",
