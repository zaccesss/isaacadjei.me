This post covers both protocols in enough depth to make those problems understandable.",

It uses four signal lines: MOSI (master out, slave in), MISO (master in, slave out), SCLK (serial clock) and CS (chip select, active low, one per device). The master generates the clock and drives CS low to select a specific slave. Data is shifted out on MOSI and in on MISO simultaneously on every clock edge. This is full-duplex operation: both sides send and receive at the same time.",

This keeps the protocol extremely simple but means each additional device requires one additional GPIO pin on the master. With five SPI devices you need five CS pins. Some designs use a daisy-chain topology to share CS but this complicates firmware and is rarely worth the effort.",

It uses two open-drain signal lines: SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock). Open-drain means each device can pull the line low but cannot actively drive it high - the lines are pulled high by external resistors, typically 4.7 kΩ for standard mode or 2.2 kΩ for fast mode. This design allows multiple masters and multiple slaves on the same two wires.",

The addressed slave responds with an ACK (pulling SDA low during the ninth clock pulse). Data bytes follow, each acknowledged by the receiver. A STOP condition (SDA released high while SCL is high) ends the transaction. This handshake overhead is why I2C is slower than SPI even at the same clock frequency.",

Pull-ups that are too strong (too low resistance) increase power consumption and can violate device input voltage specs.
