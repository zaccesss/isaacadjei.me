Every microcontroller has at least one UART peripheral. It requires only two wires: TX (transmit) and RX (receive). And once you have it working, debugging embedded firmware becomes dramatically easier because you can print register values, state machine transitions and error codes to a serial monitor in real time.",

        text: "UART is asynchronous: there is no shared clock signal between sender and receiver. Instead both sides agree on a baud rate (bits per second) in advance and each uses its own internal clock to time the bit periods. A standard UART frame consists of a start bit (logic low), 5-8 data bits (LSB first by default), an optional parity bit and one or two stop bits (logic high). The most common configuration is 8N1: eight data bits, no parity, one stop bit.",
      },
      {
        type: "p",
        text: "The start bit is how the receiver knows a frame has begun: the line is normally held high (idle) and a falling edge signals the start of transmission. The receiver samples each data bit at the midpoint of its bit period. Getting the baud rate right is critical: even a 2% error in baud rate can cause the receiver to sample at the wrong point and corrupt data, especially at higher baud rates or over longer bit sequences.",

In normal speed mode (U2X = 0), the formula is: UBRR = (F_CPU / (16 * BAUD)) - 1. At 20 MHz and 9600 baud this gives 129.2, rounding to 129 for a 0.2% error. At 115200 baud it gives 9.85, rounding to 10 for a 1.4% error.

This is entirely enabled by the printf-over-UART setup described above. During development it eliminated most of the guess-and-check cycle that bare-metal embedded debugging otherwise requires. The ability to print 'mode=4 brightness=187' to the terminal and have it appear in real time is worth the two hours of UART setup.",
