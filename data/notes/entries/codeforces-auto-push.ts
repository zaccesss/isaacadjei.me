The original **LeetHub** extension (QasimWani) started the pattern: a Manifest V2 Chrome extension that injects a content script into the submission result page, detects an accepted verdict and pushes the solution to GitHub via a stored PAT. LeetCode has since changed its frontend enough that the original is partially broken, so the community maintains forks. **LeetHub 3.0** (raphaelheinz) is the actively maintained version as of 2025. **LeetSync** takes a different approach - it uses the LeetCode API directly to fetch submission data rather than scraping the DOM, then writes to GitHub. LeetCode does not have any official built-in GitHub integration of its own; all sync tools are community-built extensions.",

It includes a streak tracker, a problem rating chart and GitHub OAuth integration. It uses the Codeforces API (`user.status` endpoint at `codeforces.com/apiHelp/methods`) for metadata and a content script to capture the source code from the submission page (since the API does not return source code). CFPusher is open source - if there are missing features or bugs, contributing directly makes more sense than building from scratch.",

The auto-push tooling for AtCoder is less mature and less actively maintained than the LeetCode equivalents. There is no well-maintained Chrome extension for AtCoder equivalent to CFPusher.",
