    "What started as a single-tournament World Cup predictor never shipped in time for the 2026 tournament - Spain won it in the end and I was still building the pipeline when the group stage kicked off on 11 June. Rather than treat one missed deadline as the end of the idea, I'm generalising it into an open-ended platform: football, basketball, tennis, cricket, motorsport, rugby, athletics and volleyball, with the list growing over time rather than fixed at launch.",

      text: "The original plan was a calibrated Poisson baseline followed by an XGBoost model on the full feature set, with Monte Carlo simulation running the full World Cup bracket 100,000 times to produce proper win probabilities rather than a single predicted winner. I got as far as the data collection and baseline model work, but the web app and the live-updating prediction layer weren't ready by 11 June 2026, so the project quietly missed its own deadline. The tournament played out without it and Spain lifted the trophy.",

      type: "p",
      text: "None of that work was wasted, though. The actual hard part of a project like this - a calibrated ratings system, a gradient-boosted model over engineered features, Monte Carlo simulation for proper uncertainty quantification, a web app that visualises probabilities rather than just a predicted winner - is not really about football specifically. It is a general architecture for predicting competitive outcomes. Rebuilding it as a single-tournament, single-sport tool a second time would just recreate the same one-shot deadline problem. Generalising it into an ongoing, open-ended multi-sport platform is a better use of the same groundwork - one that keeps growing rather than expiring on a fixed date.",

        "Football: the top European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga), the Champions League, the Euros, Copa America and the World Cup itself for the next cycle. This is where the original model work already exists, so it's the starting point.",
        "Basketball: the NBA to start with, since box-score data is the most complete and standardised of any sport here. High-scoring, frequent fixtures (82 games a season plus playoffs) means far more training data per team per season than football and back-to-back game fatigue is a real, modellable feature that football doesn't have an equivalent of.",
        "Tennis: individual rather than team matchups across the ATP and WTA tours, so the model is closer to a head-to-head Elo system than a team-strength regression. Surface matters enormously (clay, grass, hard court), so ratings need to be surface-specific rather than one global number per player.",
        "Cricket: format-dependent in a way none of the other sports are - T20, ODI and Test are close to different sports statistically (run rate dynamics, match length, the toss, follow-on rules), so each format likely needs its own model rather than one shared cricket model. Covers both international cricket and the major domestic T20 leagues.",
        "Motorsport (Formula 1): split into a qualifying model and a race model, with separate constructor and driver components, plus weather and tyre-strategy features that don't map onto anything in the other sports here.",
        "Rugby (union): international tests (Six Nations, The Rugby Championship, the Rugby World Cup) plus the major club competitions. Scoring is lower-frequency and higher-variance per score than football (tries, conversions, penalties, drop goals each worth different points), which changes the goal-modelling approach entirely from the football Poisson baseline.",
        "Athletics and running: track and field plus distance running (marathons and road races). A genuinely different prediction problem from every team sport here - it is about predicting an individual time or place in a field of competitors rather than a match outcome, closer to a ranking/regression problem than a win-probability one.",
        "Volleyball: international and major domestic leagues. Rally-scoring and the best-of-five-sets format make it closer to tennis's individual-set structure than to football's single continuous score, but it is a team sport, so the team-strength side of the model looks more like basketball's.",

What changes per sport is the feature engineering and the specific rules layered on top: football's Poisson goal model, basketball's pace-adjusted scoring model, tennis and volleyball's surface- or format-adjusted Elo, cricket's per-format split, motorsport's qualifying-plus-race two-stage model, rugby's points-type breakdown and athletics' switch from a win-probability model to a time/placement regression. Adding a new sport to the platform later should mean writing one new adapter against the shared core, not rebuilding the whole pipeline again.",

The actual lesson from missing the World Cup deadline wasn't 'football is too hard to predict in time', it was 'a one-shot project tied to a single tournament date has no room for slippage and slippage is normal in any real project'. An ongoing, open-ended multi-sport platform doesn't have that failure mode: each sport ships when it's ready, there's always another season, meet or tournament for it to be useful for and treating the sport list as something that keeps growing rather than fixed at eight is a much better return on the modelling work already done than a single rebuilt World Cup predictor would have been.",
