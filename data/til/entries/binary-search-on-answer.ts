    body: "The classic binary search finds a value in a sorted array. But the deeper insight: binary search works on any monotone predicate. If the predicate is false for small values and true for large values (or vice versa) with no non-monotone region in between, you can binary search for the boundary. Problems like 'find the minimum speed such that all packages are delivered in D days' fit this pattern: the predicate is 'is it possible at this value?' and binary search finds the threshold.",
