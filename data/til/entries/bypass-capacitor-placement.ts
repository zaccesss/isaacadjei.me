    body: "A bypass (decoupling) capacitor smooths voltage spikes on the power supply of an IC. At high switching frequencies, the parasitic inductance of PCB traces makes even short runs significant: inductance is proportional to trace length. A 100 nF capacitor placed 10 mm away from the IC power pin may not suppress the spike at all because the trace inductance resonates with the capacitor and creates a notch at exactly the wrong frequency. During the audio amplifier build I learned this the hard way when a distant bypass cap did nothing for high-frequency noise.",

        text: "The general rule: a 100 nF ceramic capacitor as close as possible to each VCC pin and a 10 µF bulk capacitor somewhere on the power rail to handle lower-frequency transients. For high-speed ICs (clock above 100 MHz), a second smaller cap (10 nF) placed even closer can handle the very fast edges. The return path matters as much as the cap placement: a ground pour under the IC with a short trace to the cap's ground pin completes the loop. A long ground trace adds inductance that undoes the benefit of placing the cap close.",
