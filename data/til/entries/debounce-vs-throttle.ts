    body: "Both debounce and throttle reduce how often a function runs, but they solve different problems. Debounce delays execution until the event stops firing: if the user keeps typing, the function never fires until there is a pause. Throttle guarantees the function fires at most once per time window regardless of how many events arrive. Debounce is right for search-as-you-type (fire when the user stops). Throttle is right for scroll handlers or resize (fire consistently during the event stream, not just at the end).",
