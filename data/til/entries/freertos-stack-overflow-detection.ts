Method 1 checks whether the stack pointer moved outside the valid range at the moment of a context switch. Method 2 fills the stack with a known pattern (0xA5) at task creation and checks the last 16 bytes at each context switch. Both trigger vApplicationStackOverflowHook if a violation is found.",

If the stack overflowed deeply during task execution and then recovered (a transient overflow), Method 1 misses it entirely. Method 2 is slower because it checks the watermark pattern on every switch, but it catches overflows that already happened and left a trace.",
