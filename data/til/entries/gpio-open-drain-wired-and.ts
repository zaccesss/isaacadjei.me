    body: "In push-pull mode a GPIO actively drives high or low. In open-drain mode it can only pull low or release the line to float: the external pull-up resistor pulls it high when no device is pulling down. If you connect multiple open-drain outputs to the same line, the line is low if ANY device pulls low: this is wired-AND. [I2C](https://www.i2c-bus.org/i2c-primer/) uses this for both SDA and SCL so that any device on the bus can signal a busy state or stretch the clock without needing to coordinate bus ownership first.",

        text: "The pull-up resistor value matters: too high (e.g. 100 kΩ) makes the rise time slow when all devices release the line; too low (e.g. 100 Ω) wastes power. The I2C spec gives maximum rise time requirements based on bus speed: 1000 ns for standard mode (100 kHz) and 300 ns for fast mode (400 kHz). You work backwards from the rise time requirement to the maximum pull-up resistance for your bus capacitance.",
