    body: "When you operate on two NumPy arrays with different shapes, [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) determines what happens. The rule: align shapes right-to-left; a dimension is compatible if it is equal or one of them is 1. Size-1 dimensions are stretched to match the other without copying memory. A `(3, 1)` column vector and a `(1, 4)` row vector broadcast to `(3, 4)`. This is not a loop: it is a zero-copy view processed with SIMD instructions.",
