Abstraction exposes only what the caller needs to know, hiding the implementation behind an interface or base class. A bank account class demonstrates both: encapsulation means the balance field is private; abstraction means the `transfer()` method hides the ledger logic. You can have encapsulation without abstraction but the two together produce the cleanest APIs.",
