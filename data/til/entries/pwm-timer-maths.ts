    body: "A hardware timer counts from 0 to ARR (Auto-Reload Register), then resets. The output pin goes high at 0 and goes low when the counter reaches CCR (Capture/Compare Register). So duty cycle = CCR / (ARR + 1). The PWM frequency = timer clock / (prescaler * (ARR + 1)). Changing CCR at runtime changes duty cycle without touching the frequency: this is how you dim an LED or control a servo without software delays.",
