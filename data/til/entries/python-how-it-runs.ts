This is not machine code: it is a sequence of opcodes for the CPython stack-based virtual machine. The VM interprets these opcodes one by one. This is why CPython is slower than compiled languages: every operation goes through the interpreter loop. Tools like [Cython](https://cython.org/), [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) bypass this by compiling to actual machine code.",
