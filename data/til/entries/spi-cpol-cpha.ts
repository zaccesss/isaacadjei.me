A device is only guaranteed to correctly receive data in the mode it was designed for. If master and peripheral are in different modes, the data appears shifted or garbled with no error signal: SPI has no acknowledgement mechanism. The device datasheet always specifies which mode (0, 1, 2 or 3) to use.",
