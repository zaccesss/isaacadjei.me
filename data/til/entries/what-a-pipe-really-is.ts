    body: "When you write `ls | grep foo`, the shell calls the [`pipe()` syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html). The kernel allocates a 64 KB ring buffer and hands back two file descriptors: one read end and one write end. Both processes see it as a file descriptor, but there is no file on disk. The write blocks when the buffer is full and the read blocks when it is empty. This blocking behaviour is why slow producers naturally throttle fast consumers in a pipeline.",
